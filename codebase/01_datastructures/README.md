# 1. Data Structures

Data structures help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations. Common data structures include linked lists, stacks, queues and trees each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.

## 1.1. Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
